## Introduction
This TFM deals with two new technologies that, a priori, should not have anything in common. On the one hand, we have the blockchain technology. At a time when corruption and transparency are two issues that are present every day, studying a technology that treats them fully becomes very stimulating. On the other hand, the author’s career has led him to work building web applications, architectures and microservices. Encouraged by the director of this project, the more he discovered about cloud platforms and possibilities such as lambda functions, the more he believes that the future is to go in that direction. It was necessary to verify if both technologies could be combined and benefit.


The aim of this project is to verify if one can really abstract the functionality of blockchain technology using serverless computing, making it lighter, while maintaining all the intrinsic benefits of its own technology. The realization of the solution has involved depth study of both technologies and multitude of tests and test cases to find a satisfactory solution. In order to demonstrate how both technologies work, the project has been based on an example of banking application with transactions and accounts simulating other existing blockchain platforms such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The example should always serve as a vehicle to demonstrate in a simpler way how both technologies can be combined.
