## Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a blockchain solution by externalising part of its processing to a cloud services platform.

The final solution consists in the development of a digital bank whose support is an own network blockchain. Users will be able to connect to this network through a client and interact with their bank account. Within the client, users will be able to check the status of their account, the rest of existing accounts in the bank and make transfers to any of them by making a transaction through the blockchain.

Both the flow of the client’s program and the operations and updates of the blockchain network and bank accounts are carried out in each client’s local code. On the other hand, all the control of the connections between the different connected users is carried out through cloud computing.

In addition, it is made available, through a cloud storage service and publicly, the current status of bank accounts and the history of the blockchain directly to be consumed by any application. In this same storage is also saved a log file of the movements of the last iteration of the blockchain that can be used for later animated visualization.
